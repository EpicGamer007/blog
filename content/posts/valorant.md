# Valorant is an absolute pain

I started playing [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com) in December of 2022, during my Winter Break during school. I tried to get my friend to play Halo: Custom Edition but he convinced me to try out his game, Valorant. I had heard about it before but never really *knew* it. My information was a YouTube comment saying "It was if CSGO and Overwatch had a child". After falling down the rabbit hole and spending countless hours on the game, here are my thoughts on it.

**BTW, here is my tracker: https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/MisterChief7%2300000/overview**

## The Good:
* I like the game overall. The gunplay and focus on good aim and smart movement combined with agent choice feels great overall. 
* Every agent is arguably fun. I main Viper, a controller. However, I can play almost every agent and they all have their ups and downs.
## The Bad:
* Instalockers are a real pain
* Its addicting AF
* Team compositions are trash
* I get tilted a lot of the times

Who am I kidding, I just suck at the game ðŸ˜•
