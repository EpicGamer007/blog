# College Applications: The Line Between Passion and Fluff

**I wrote half this blog in July 2023, and I wrote the other half on July 2024**

Crammed into a bleacher seat with two of my friends on both sides, I stared mindlessly towards the principal giving his speech in front of the school. Despite the pleas of the educational staff earlier, chatter could be felt echoing throughout the gym. My English teacher, who taught the large mass on the floor two years ago, stood up and began to talk about *beyond high school plans*. When I started my journey of high school, I focused purely on doing good in high school while failing to recognize the long term importance of high school and how valuable this time is. This is my time to set my future self up for success, and when I realized that, I stared intently at the flock of students while listening to my English teacher call up his former students.

The manner in which the seniors stood up was simple. The speaker would call a location and in turn, students going to that location after high school would put down whatever rubbish they had in their hands and stand up. He started far and travelled closer to home: International students, East Coast, South, Midwest, North, and West (making sure not to exclude gap-year and direct-to-job students). However, of the seniors I knew, the ones who gained some of the highest praise and recognition were the ones going to highly sought after schools (for example, UC Berkley). However, this begs the question: How did they get in to these prestigious universities and programs? A simple answer that almost every high schooler would spout off is that "they got good grades, took AP Classes, and had a buncha ECs" (ECs is meant to be extracurriculars). With colleges relying on ECs at a much higher rate and people recognizing this fact, how does the average student respond?

#### Context: Extracurriculars in the Eyes of a High Schooler

To put it simply, Extracurriculars or Extracurricular Activities is the accepted term to describe "An activity outside the normal academic curriculum". How it is applied, however, is monstrously vast. Your regular chess club counts as an extracurricular. Sports teams count as an extracurricular. Volunteering counts as an extracurricular. Being on a committee counts as an extracurricular. Depending on whom you talk to, even jobs can be counted as an extracurricular. Students are never asked to do these things but typically though word of mouth, they recognize the importance of participation in these activities. Here, however, a fine line must be drawn regarding participation, leadership, initiative, and interest.

#### The Strengths of Elementary and Middle School Clubs

The days when you didn't have to worry about your future was much simpler. You reluctantly go to school, then have a bunch of fun with your friends and (hopefully) pay attention in class. You return home and play with your friends and then do your homework and sleep. Rinse and repeat. After school activities weren't as big because of how they are viewed upon as little value. But rather, this is the spot in which interest and passion can be built. No one is forced to attend an after-school robotics club because of going to college. Children attend these clubs because they are interested and have fun in building robots. This is similar in middle school, where I personally joined a coding club because of how I thought it was cool to code computers and machines. People who weren't interested after trying could exit freely. The value of these experiences is that a child is surrounded by people who are also passionate and interested in the subject at hand. You enjoy being there. 

#### When High School Enters the Field

In High School, you need to be quick to catch on to the fact that high school is where you prepare for the real world but also, college. Societal pressures and shifts have promoted college to an extensive degree and now, most students look to continue their education in college. As mentioned previously, getting into these "great" colleges who can supposedly "secure" your future is now due to more and more of these ECs. There is a push to meet new people and try new things in high school, where you may get your only opportunity ever to experience working with wood, metal, computers, and even the military. To some, these new experiences stick with them, and they continue to enjoy and take interest in this field. But in the competitive reality of college, many (including myself) have been drawn to take on new activities for the sake of improving our college applications.

#### The Impact

Taking extracurriculars that you don't want is generally not a good thing. Students lose out on time they could be spending on something they actually enjoy or value. You lose time you could be using for homework. The value you get out of doing so is much less compared to many other things you can be doing.

#### Final Words

I started this post in July 2023, and have come back to it on June 2024. Obviously, many things have changed, and I realize now, more than ever, the importance of having such a strong foundation extracurricular activities but also other skills. My advice to anyone younger than me reading this is to a find a few things you are passionate about and make an impact with them. Don't take up things for the sake of college apps, do so because you believe in the value they provide. Actually spend time on your activities and help other people, however that may be.

With one month left until my CommonApp opens, I am more stressed than ever with my future. Not only do my extracurriculars matter, but also my essays and grades. Wish me luck guys, and I wish you all the best.
